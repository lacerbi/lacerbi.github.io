### Machine & Human Intelligence

I am an associate professor at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/computer-science) of the University of Helsinki, where I lead the [Machine and Human Intelligence](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/machine-and-human-intelligence) research group. I am also an active member of the [Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence FCAI](https://fcai.fi/) and of [ELLIS (European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems)](https://ellis.eu/). 

My research spans:

- **probabilistic machine learning**, with a focus on building efficient methods for statistical inference;
- **computational and cognitive neuroscience**, with a focus on Bayesian models of perception and resource-constrained rationality.

Previously, I was a postdoc in [Alex Pouget](https://www.unige.ch/medecine/neuf/en/research/grecherche/alexandre-pouget/)‘s lab in Geneva, Switzerland, and with [Wei Ji Ma](http://www.cns.nyu.edu/malab/ "Wei Ji Ma's lab website") at NYU, NY, where I have also been an off-site visiting scholar. While in Geneva, I collaborated with the [International Brain Laboratory](https://www.internationalbrainlab.com/). I obtained my PhD at the [Doctoral Training Centre](http://www.anc.ed.ac.uk/dtc/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=12&Itemid=68 "Neuroinformatics and Computational Neuroscience DTC website") for computational neuroscience based in Edinburgh, UK, working with [Sethu Vijayakumar](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/svijayak/ "prof. Sethu Vijayakumar's webpage") and [Daniel Wolpert](http://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Wolpert/Members "prof. Daniel Wolpert's group webpage"). I spent several months of my PhD at the [Computational and Biological Learning Lab](http://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Wolpert/WebHome "Wolpertlab website") in Cambridge, UK.
